        		<h1>Hi, I'm Katie!</h1>
		<p>It's kinda weird to write about yourself, but here goes nothing. 
			<li>I love good food, good people and good ideas.</li>
			<li>I live in Toronto with my two kids, dog and husband. </li>
			<li>I've also lived in Berlin & New York.</li>
			<li>I've worn many hats. In reverse order, I've worked as a baker, a librarian, an HR partner, a community support specialist, and a community manager. </li>
			<li>I love to write. I've written newsletters, blogs, articles, recipes, scripts, company manuals and thousands upon thousands of emails for audiences big and small.</li>
			<li>I love to create things - creating things with people from scratch is my happy place, whether it's recipes, menus, movies, podcasts, zines, websites, events or even companies. </li>
			<li>I love to make people laugh, and really enjoy public speaking. I've hosted large all-company meetings, MC'd weddings and other events, and even performed standup.</li>
			<li>I'm a pop culture afficionado, and a sponge for random facts - I even won a trivia game show!</li>
