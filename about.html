        		<h1>Hi, I'm Katie!</h1>
		<p>Here is a list of things about me:  
			<li>I live in Toronto with my two kids, dog and husband. </li>
			<li>I've also lived in Berlin & New York. That was fun.</li>
			<li>Cooking and baking for my family and friends is my favourite thing to do.</li>
			<li><a href="resume.html">I've worn many hats</a>! Most recently I worked as a baker, but I've also worked as a librarian, an archivist, an HR partner, and a community manager. </li>
			<li>I have a couple degrees from the University of Toronto. A Bachelor in Music Education (where I learned that I can pick up & play most instruments within 30 minutes) and a Masters in Information (where I learned that I am very good at Googling stuff).</li> 
			<li>I love to write. I've written newsletters, blogs, articles, recipes, scripts, company manuals and thousands upon thousands of emails for audiences big and small.</li>
			<li>I love to create things - creating things with people from scratch is my happy place, whether it's recipes, menus, movies, podcasts, zines, websites, events or even companies. </li>
			<li>I love to make people laugh, and really enjoy public speaking. I've hosted large all-company meetings, MC'd weddings and other events, and performed standup.</li>
			<li>I'm a pop culture afficionado, and a sponge for random facts & song lyrics - I even won a trivia game show!</li>
			<li>For good measure: I am not great at math, and very scared of birds.</li>
